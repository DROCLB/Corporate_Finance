    "    \n",
    "    1.  **Reducing Costs of Financial Distress:**\n",
    "        *   Large uninsured losses can push a firm towards bankruptcy, incurring significant direct (legal) and indirect (lost sales, damaged reputation) costs. Insurance payouts can prevent this.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.  **Maintaining Optimal Investment:**\n",

    "    \n",
    "    3.  **Tax Benefits:**\n",
    "        *   Premiums are usually tax-deductible. Tax savings can occur if premiums are paid in high-tax periods and payouts received in low-tax periods (or when firm is loss-making).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4.  **Improving Debt Capacity & Terms:**\n",
    "        *   Reduces cash flow volatility, making the firm less risky to lenders. Can lead to higher debt capacity or better loan terms (lower interest rates, fewer covenants).\n",
